                        Tyrannosaurus rex, or T. rex, was a massive bipedal carnivore that lived in western North
                        America around
                        72.7 to 66 million years ago. Despite its large size, it had short but strong forelimbs with two
                        clawed
                        digits. Known for its powerful jaws and sharp teeth, T. rex was one of the largest known land
                        predators. Its
                        keen sense of smell made it an adept hunter.

                        Spinosaurus was a spinosaurid dinosaur that lived in North Africa during the Late Cretaceous
                        period, about
                        99 to 93.5 million years ago. It was the longest known terrestrial carnivore, with an estimated
                        length of up
                        to 14 meters. Its most distinctive feature was the long extensions of the vertebrae, forming a
                        sail-like
                        structure. It is believed to have hunted both terrestrial and aquatic prey.

                        Triceratops was a herbivorous dinosaur known for its three horns and large bony frill. It lived
                        during the
                        Late Cretaceous period and was one of the last non-avian dinosaurs. Triceratops is the most

                        dinosaur in the uppermost Cretaceous deposits of western North America.

                        Velociraptor, often depicted in popular media, was a small carnivorous dinosaur that lived
                        during the Late
                        Cretaceous epoch in Asia. Known for its speed and agility, it had a long tail and an enlarged
                        sickle-shaped
                        claw on each hindfoot, which it likely used to tackle and restrain prey. Despite its fierce
                        reputation,
                        Velociraptor was about the size of a turkey.
