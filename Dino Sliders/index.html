            Tyrannosaurus rex, or T. rex, was a massive bipedal carnivore that lived in western North America around
            72.7 to 66 million years ago. Despite its large size, it had short but strong forelimbs with two clawed
            digits. Known for its powerful jaws and sharp teeth, T. rex was one of the largest known land predators. Its
            keen sense of smell made it an adept hunter.

            Spinosaurus was a spinosaurid dinosaur that lived in North Africa during the Late Cretaceous period, about
            99 to 93.5 million years ago. It was the longest known terrestrial carnivore, with an estimated length of up
            to 14 meters. Its most distinctive feature was the long extensions of the vertebrae, forming a sail-like
            structure. It is believed to have hunted both terrestrial and aquatic prey.

            Triceratops was a herbivorous dinosaur known for its three horns and large bony frill. It lived during the
            Late Cretaceous period and was one of the last non-avian dinosaurs. Triceratops is the most commonly found
            dinosaur in the uppermost Cretaceous deposits of western North America.

            Velociraptor, often depicted in popular media, was a small carnivorous dinosaur that lived during the Late
            Cretaceous epoch in Asia. Known for its speed and agility, it had a long tail and an enlarged sickle-shaped
            claw on each hindfoot, which it likely used to tackle and restrain prey. Despite its fierce reputation,
            Velociraptor was about the size of a turkey.
